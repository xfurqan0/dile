//! Backend module loading and compute-device discovery.
//!
//! In a static (or plain `shared`) build the compiled-in backends are already
//! registered and [`init_backends`] is a harmless no-op. In a `dynamic-backends`
//! build the compute backends are loadable modules; a host points the library at
//! the provider directory ONCE, before the first model load — use
//! [`init_backends_default`] when the modules sit next to libtranscribe, or
//! [`init_backends`] with an explicit bundled provider directory. See the C
//! header's backend-module section for the degradation contract.
